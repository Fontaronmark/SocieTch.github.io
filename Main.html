                In the past years the media has been, and still continuously being stripped off of their freedom, journalists were killed and some media outlets were shut down. Free press is a fundamental aspect of democracy, allowing the public access to diverse information and fostering transparency, but due to this unjust system, our website aims to give a tribute to those journalists for their bravery. Which we believe could be an inspiration to our aspiring future journalists.

                Attacking journalists has far-reaching consequences, not only for individuals involved but for the society as a whole. The landscape of media has been enormously invaded by fear due to several events, where some journalists are being harassed and the potential risk might put them in an unfavorable situation. Given that journalists play a vital role in holding governments and institutions accountable, their determination to disseminate awareness for each individual has been out of bound. With that, continuous attacks emerge and make a huge effect on the media, discouraging journalists from pursuing investigative reporting or covering critical issues. Moreover, execution of journalists contributes to a decline in public trust in media outlets and institutions, as they serve as the key instrument in the area of press media.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>          
              Besides, persistent attacks can lead to diplomatic consequences and strain relationships with other countries. In our society, especially nowadays, issues such as corruption, human rights abuses, and social injustices might go unreported if attacks continue, hindering positive change. Eventually, lack of diverse perspectives limits public discourse, interfering societal understanding. The impact of attacking journalists goes beyond individual cases; as it shapes the landscape of information, governance, and societal progress. Keeping safe of journalist's integrity safe is not just a matter of protecting a profession; it is about preserving the very essence of democracy and human rights.
