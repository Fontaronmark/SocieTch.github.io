                Societech is a website that mainly talks about Press Freedom; a social issue that affects mostly journalists, broadcasters, and other people in the field of Journalism. Press Freedom holds the people to publish information and their expressions without the fear, and the hindrance of facing potential threats, harassments, and red-tagging.
